## Deploying backend

This repository contains a SQL schema (db.js) and a backend nodejs server (server.js) 

1. You are going to want to run the SQL schema in a database and it will construct all the fields you need. 

IMPORTANT: You are also going to need to modify the .env to have a much more secure (ideally hashed) JWT secret

2. You will need to reconfigure the .env file in the /src directory to your database configuration details.

3. Inside src\components\res\FetchFunc.js replace 'http://localhost:8080' with the URL of your backend.

4. Inside src\server\server.js customise the limiter constant to include the desired values 

5. Deploy server.js by going \quiz-app\src\server and run 'node server.js'
